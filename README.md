### LEVEL GENERATION IN MARIO

## Running the level generator.

- To run the level generator you just simply need to run the file:
`PlayLevelGroupD.java`

- 10 Text file levels will be generated automatically, there are some placeholders in place at the moment.
- Please make sure the directory file is correct, an example - `src/groupD/LEVEL_NAME.txt`.
